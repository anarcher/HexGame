Optimizations in Montecarlo GameResult:

	* playing only on slots in the vector "move" that the State object has.
	* finishing the 121 moves, and only then see who has won, because there is always a winner
	* 


To be done:

	* logic of the AI game â€¦ ????
	* check logic behind removal of moves from the "move" Vector in GameResult().


Notes:

	* It seems like White is playing top-down (!?)
	* Reasonable waiting-time until 70'000 games per candidate move.
